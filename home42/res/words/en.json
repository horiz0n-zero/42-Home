    "faq1": "No, the app basically does what remains essential for a 42 student, view profile, cluster, events, projects, gain knowledge through earning. Some features and actions simply remain unavailable with the API.",
    "faqq2": "The graph is not displayed in the same way as on the intra is it serious doctor?",
    "faq2": "No, the application only displays the information returned to it by the \"\/project_data\" call from the intra (the API does not allow you to build the graph). Valuable information is missing to build the graph correctly visually. It would be time and energy consuming to make the application always in sync by making patches by hand, plus the application would need to update constantly.",
    "faqq3": "Some pages display a \"!\" Why ?",
    "faq3": "The API can return erroneous results, these indicators are there to warn you not to rely 100% on the results.",
    "faqq4": "What technologies are used in the application?",
    "faq4": "The application is developed in Apple's Swift language in its version 5.7 minimum. Available from iOS 15.0. Xcode 14.0 minimum.\n The interface mainly uses the UIKit framework, for widgets we will find the SwiftUI framework. Dependencies are used to manage by CocoaPods:\n - To encrypt user data\n - Better handle text formatting for dates in all languages",
    "faqq5": "Not available on Android?",
    "faq5": "No. And she won't squeeze it, this application is developed natively on IOS.",
    "faqq6": "My intra photo to change but I don't see any change in the Application?",
    "faq6": "With a view to being reactive and fluid. The app stores profile photos, completion images, and coalition backgrounds and images. Saving a lot of bandwidth. To delete or know the size consumed by each \"cache\", go to the settings and access the \"cache\" section. When an intra photo changes the application may still display the old photo, simply delete the cache in the settings to force a new download.",
    "faqq7": "I found a bug! What to do ?",
    "faq7": "Perfection does not exist ! Especially coming from a project entirely coded on a voluntary basis: Shake your device when you are connected, an email will be generated with crucial information on the state of your application, remember to add your description of the problem and how you got there.",
    "faqq8": "Does the application use a service similar to Google Analytics?",
    "faq8": "No service allowing yours truly to retrieve any information about your habits in the application is used. We are counting on you to provide feedback on the application to better understand what works well, what does not work, what is not intuitive, what is really used, what could come out in a future update. priority day. Don't forget, never shake your device to write an email to yours truly.",
    "faqq9": "The cluster of my campus is not available, is there a way to have it in a next update?",
    "faq9": "Go immediately to the Guides section at the bottom of your screen in the settings. and follow the pdf which will explain how to do it.",
    "faqq10": "I can't spend my Wallets in the store? I also see articles not visible on my intranet.",
    "faq10": "The store presents the products of all the campuses, moreover, the API does not allow anything to buy.",
    "faqq11": "Why are the lists of logins displayed from Z to A?",
    "faq11": "The API does not offer a filter to not display \"3b3-XXXX\" anonymized profiles so to avoid paging through hundreds of results containing anonymized profiles, logins are displayed from Z to A.",
